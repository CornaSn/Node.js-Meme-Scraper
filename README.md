# Node.js Meme Scraper

A Command Line Interface (cli) application that scrapes the current version of this website:

https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/

It saves the first 10 images, named 01.jpg, 02.jpg etc., into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project.

## Credits
This is a Node.js project I completed during the PERN-extensive (Immersive) Spring 2024 bootcamp at [UpLeveled](https://github.com/upleveled)
